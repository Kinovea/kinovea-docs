Screens panel
=============

The screens panel replaces the thumbnails panel when one or more screens are opened.
When two screens of the same type are opened, joint controls are added at the bottom.

Adding and removing screens can be done by using the main toolbar, the menu View or the close buttons on the screens themselves.

To swap the screens use the menu :menuselection:`View --> Swap screens` or the swap button in the joint controls.
