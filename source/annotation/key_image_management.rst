Key images
================================

Images marked as key images show up in the key image panel below the viewport as well as in the side panel. Key images can be used to quickly navigate and annotate important moments in the video. They can have a title, comments and a color associated with them.

Side panel
---------------

The key image tab in the side panel contains a card for each key image and is where you may change the title, color, and add comments to the selected key image.

Changing the time of a key image
---------------------------------------------

To change the time of a key image you can drag its thumbnail from the bottom panel and drop it to a new position in the timeline.

Alternatively you can move to the desired time, then right click the thumbnail and select :menuselection:`Move to current time` to set the time of the key image to the current frame in the viewport.


Key image presets
------------------------------

It is possible to create key image presets to quickly add key images with a predefined title and color, using a keyboard shortcut.

To define the presets, go to the preferences via menu :menuselection:`Options --> Preferences --> Drawings --> Presets`.

.. tip:: If you need to add key images with comments and drawings you can save a template annotation file and load it into the video when needed or set it as default annotation file. Then move the existing key images to their correct time.
