Annotating videos
=================

Introduction
------------
Annotation tools are used to add drawings and text to images of the video.
Some tools can also be used to measure distances or display coordinates.

Drawings are attached to a specific key image.
Deleting the key image deletes all the drawings attached to it.

Drawings are vector-based: they can be modified after they have been added to the video.

Drawings have a context menu that can be used to access style options, visibility configuration, tool-specific functions, tracking management, copy and paste, support and deletion.

While a tool is active, right clicking the viewport opens the color profile at the page of the active tool.

Tool bar
------------

The tool bar is found under the main viewport.

There are more tools than those immediately visible. 
Buttons with a small arrow in the top-left corner contain other tools that can be accessed by doing a right click or a long click (click and hold) on the button.
