Importing images and vector drawings
====================================

Importing external images
-------------------------
In addition to opening image files as if they were videos you may import images and vector drawings into videos to create a picture in picture effect.

TODO: illustration of picture in picture.

To import an image file in the current video use the menu Tools > Observational references > Import image.

To import an image that you have copied in the clipboard in another application, 
right click the video background and use the menu Paste image from clipboard.

To transfer an image from one screen to the other use the menu Copy image to clipboard and then paste it in the other video.

Built-in vector-based references
--------------------------------

The menu Tools > Observational references contains a number of entries with built-in vector drawings such as a human skeleton or a protractor.
