Importing images and vector drawings
====================================

Importing external images
-------------------------
In addition to opening image files as if they were videos, you may import images and vector drawings into videos to create a picture in picture effect.

To import an image file in the current video use the menu :menuselection:`Tools --> Observational references --> Import imageâ€¦`.

To import an image that you have copied in the clipboard in another application, 
right click the video background and use the menu :menuselection:`Paste image from clipboard`.

To transfer an image from one screen to the other, use the menu :menuselection:`Copy image to clipboard` and then paste it in the other video.

Built-in vector-based references
--------------------------------

The menu :menuselection:`Tools --> Observational references` contain a number of entries with built-in vector drawings such as a human skeleton or a protractor.
