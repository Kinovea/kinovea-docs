Comparison
==============================

Comparison
----------
Two videos can be opened side by side using the :guilabel:`Two playback screens` button or the menu :menuselection:`View --> Two playback screens`.

The timeline cursor in each playback screen can be moved independently.

Superposition
-------------
Superposition paints each video on top of the other at 50% opacity.
This is a basic mechanism to compare motion in-situ if the videos were filmed in the same environment with a static camera.
