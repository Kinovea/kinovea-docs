Kinograms
=============
The overview mode is a special video mode used to display multiple images of the video at the same time.
This type of display is also called a "kinogram".
It can be used to create a single-image summary of the whole video sequence.

To enter the overview mode, use the menu :menuselection:`Video --> Overview`.

.. tip:: The overview mode is only enabled when the entire working zone is cached in memory. 
    To change the amount of memory used for the cache go to :menuselection:`Options --> Preferences --> Playback --> Memory`.

When the Overview mode is active the main image viewport displays a collection of frames taken from the video at regular intervals. 
The playback controls are disabled.

To control the number of images displayed use the **mouse wheel**. The display can be set between 2x2 and 10x10 images. 

To quit the Overview mode, use the close button in the top-right corner of the playback screen.
