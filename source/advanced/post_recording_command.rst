Post-recording commands 
=========================

Post-recording commands let you execute external programs right after a recording is finalized, using the created file as an argument to these programs. This can be used to automatically copy the file to a different location, perform compression or apply post-processing.

Command editor
----------------

To enable post-recording commands right click the background of a capture screen and choose the menu :menuselection:`Post-recording commandâ€¦`. Check the :guilabel:`Enable post-recording command` checkbox and enter the command line to execute.

You can call multiple programs, add each command on its own line. The commands are executed sequentially and the whole thing runs in a background thread.

Lines starting with ``#`` are treated as comments and ignored.

Variables
---------

Use the button :guilabel:`Insert a variable` to insert context variables that will be replaced with actual values when the command is executed. In addition to the user-defined variables and the date and time built-in variables, the following are available in this context:
