This dialog brings the configuration options described below. The same options are available later by clicking on the "Configure camera" button in the capture screen.

Configuration

The values for the options depend on the particular brand of network camera and your own network configuration. The most important setting is the Final URL, this is the URL used by Kinovea to connect to the camera stream.

Clicking the Test button will try to connect to the camera and report success or failure.

Smartphones
-----------

Smartphones can be used as network cameras over the WiFi network by using a dedicated application, provided it supports streaming in MJPEG.
For example "IP Webcam" by Pavel Khlebovich can be used on Android devices.

Consult the application to find the URL of the server and the IP address of the smartphone.
