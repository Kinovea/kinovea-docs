Description
-----------
The angle-angle diagram is a qualitative plot showing the dynamics of a movement pattern over multiple trials.
This type of diagram correlates two angular measurements over time to highlight their interaction.

This can be used to study the coordination of the knee and hip during flexion or extension for example.

Data source
-----------
The data source list the angle objects that are plotted on each axis.

Data type
*********
The data type drop down sets the kinematic quantity used for the variable-variable chart.
The following options are available:

* Angle
* Angular velocity
* Tangential velocity

Export options
--------------
The data can be exported to an image or to tabular data.
For tabular data the output has only two column, correlating the first angle value with the second value at the same point in time.
