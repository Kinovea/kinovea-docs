Program updates
====================

New versions are published on the project website: 

https://www.kinovea.org/download.html

To check if a new version has been published from within the program itself you can use the menu :menuselection:`Help --> Check for updates`.
This function requires an Internet connection.

The function simply consults a text file on the web server that contains the version number of the latest published version.
There is no automatic update mechanism, to update you must download and install the new version manually.
