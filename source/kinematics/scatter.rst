The scatter diagram displays the positions of the marker objects in the video.
The axes are based on the calibrated coordinate system. 

This can be used to get a bird's eye view of the contact points of a ball on the ground for example.

Data source
-----------
The data source is the whole set of marker objects.

Calibration plane
*****************
This option highlights the area covered by the perspective grid used to calibrate the coordinate space.

Export options
--------------
The data can be exported to an image or to tabular data.
For tabular data the points are sorted by time; the first column is the time in milliseconds, the second and third columns are the X and Y positions.
